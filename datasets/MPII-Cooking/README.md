MPII Cooking dataset is a fine-grained cooking activity dataset, which is originally built for action detection. In our benchmark, we obtain action clips containing one action label given the official temporal annotation. The raw videos are recorded based on 12 participants, and we use videos from 10 subjects as the training set.
