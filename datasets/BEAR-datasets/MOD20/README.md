MOD20 is a multi-viewpoint outdoor dataset collected from both YouTube videos and a drone camera, which alleviates the dataset scarcity in terms of viewpoint. Specifically, there are totally four types of views in MOD20, three of which are above the person and the fourth is an elevation view. Furthermore, these two datasets only contain coarse sports categories, ignoring the analysis of sub-actions within a sports event, which may weaken the scope of our benchmark.
